The `AndroidApplication` folder is the source code of the mobile app, the `mlpacket` folder is the code of machine learning model, and the `Server` folder is the code we deployed on the server.

Please note that due to the size of the machine learning model, we did not include it in the files. Also, we deleted all the content related to the server IP and API Keys for we uploaded the code to Github.
